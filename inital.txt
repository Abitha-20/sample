### Fact

```
FACT is a property of the remote node. Whenever you run any playbook, `ANSIBLE` gathers the FACTS of all the remote machines, before it executes the tasks.
This ways it comes to know whether it has to do the task or not.

Like if you ask to install some XYZ, it don't have to go and check and then install.
During facts itself it has that info and if that XYZ is alreayd, it will just `SKIP`

# This will show you the list of all the FACTS that ANISBLE is collecting during the PLAYBOOK execution

$ ansible all -m setup
